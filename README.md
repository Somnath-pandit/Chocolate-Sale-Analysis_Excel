# Advanced Sales Analysis Project

## Overview

This project aims to perform a detailed sales analysis using Microsoft Excel, providing insights into sales patterns, identifying key performance indicators, and facilitating data-driven decision-making. The dataset consists of sales data from multiple geographies and products, allowing for an in-depth exploration and analysis.

## Project Objectives

1. **Quick Statistics**: Generate key statistical metrics to understand the overall distribution and central tendency of the sales data.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Conduct a thorough EDA to identify patterns, trends, and outliers in the dataset.
3. **Sales by Country**: Analyze and compare sales performance across different countries using formulas and pivot tables.
4. **Top Products Analysis**: Identify the top-performing products based on sales per unit to highlight high-value items.
5. **Anomaly Detection**: Detect and address any anomalies in the dataset to ensure data accuracy and reliability.
6. **Best Salesperson by Country**: Determine the top salesperson in each country based on total sales amount.
7. **Profit Analysis**: Calculate the profitability of each product, taking into account the total cost and sales amount.
8. **Dynamic Reporting**: Create dynamic, real-time country-level sales reports to facilitate ongoing analysis.
9. **Product Discontinuation Analysis**: Assess products for potential discontinuation based on their sales performance and profit margins.

## Data Description

The dataset includes the following columns:
- **Sales Person**: Name of the salesperson
- **Geography**: Country where the sale occurred
- **Product**: Name of the product sold
- **Amount**: Sales amount in local currency
- **Units**: Number of units sold
- **Cost Per Unit**: Cost of each unit in local currency
- **Total Cost**: Total cost for the units sold

## Methodology

### 1. Quick Statistics

Generated key statistics such as mean, median, minimum, maximum, range, and quartiles for both the sales amount and the units sold.

### 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Performed detailed EDA to identify trends, patterns, and outliers in the sales data. This included:
- Summary statistics
- Distribution analysis
- Correlation analysis
- Visualization of sales trends

### 3. Sales by Country

Analyzed sales data by country using both formulas and pivot tables. This included:
- Summing sales amounts and units sold for each country
- Creating pivot tables to dynamically filter and analyze data by geography

### 4. Top Products Analysis

Identified the top 5 products based on sales per unit. This involved:
- Calculating the sales per unit for each product
- Ranking products to determine the highest-performing items

### 5. Anomaly Detection

Investigated the dataset for any anomalies or inconsistencies. This included:
- Checking for data entry errors
- Identifying outliers that might indicate erroneous data
- Ensuring data integrity

### 6. Best Salesperson by Country

Determined the best salesperson in each country based on total sales amount. This involved:
- Summing sales amounts for each salesperson within each country
- Identifying the top performer in each region

### 7. Profit Analysis

Calculated the profitability of each product. This included:
- Summing total sales amounts and total costs for each product
- Calculating total profit for each product
- Ranking products by profitability

### 8. Dynamic Reporting

Created dynamic country-level sales reports to facilitate ongoing analysis. This included:
- Building pivot tables and charts that update automatically based on data selection
- Enabling quick filtering and sorting of data by country

### 9. Product Discontinuation Analysis

Assessed products for potential discontinuation based on sales performance and profit margins. This included:
- Identifying low-performing products based on sales amount and units sold
- Calculating profit margins to determine product viability
- Recommending products for discontinuation

## Tools and Techniques

- **Microsoft Excel**: For data cleaning, analysis, and visualization
- **Pivot Tables**: For dynamic data analysis and reporting
- **Formulas and Functions**: For calculations and data manipulation
- **Conditional Formatting**: For highlighting key data points and anomalies
- **Data Visualization**: For creating charts and graphs to visualize trends and patterns

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates the power of Excel for conducting advanced sales analysis. By leveraging various Excel functionalities, we derived valuable insights into sales performance, identified key trends, and provided actionable recommendations for business decision-making.
